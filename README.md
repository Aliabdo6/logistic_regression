# 📊 Logistic Regression Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a logistic regression model as part of the Machine Learning Specialization assignment offered by **Stanford University** in collaboration with **DeepLearning.AI**.

## 📝 Project Overview

Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning. In this project, we implement logistic regression from scratch using Python and NumPy, showcasing the application of the model to a binary classification problem.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Logistic Regression from Scratch**: Implementation of logistic regression without relying on external machine learning libraries.
- **⚖️ Binary Classification**: Application of the model to a simple binary classification task.
- **⚙️ Gradient Descent Optimization**: Using gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.
- **📈 Performance Evaluation**: Evaluation of the model's performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aliabdo6/logistic_regression.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd logistic_regression
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

## ▶️ Usage

To run the logistic regression implementation, execute the following command:

```bash
python logistic_regression.py
```

You can modify the dataset and hyperparameters in the script to experiment with different scenarios.

## 📁 Files

- `logistic_regression.py`: The main implementation of the logistic regression model.
- `data.csv`: A sample dataset used for testing the model.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.

## 📊 Results

The results of the logistic regression model, including accuracy and loss, will be displayed in the console output.
